In these pages, computer dudes Darrel Wayne Creacy and Carlito Vicencio outline those advantages and then show you how to build the computer of your dreams. The pair begins by explaining what components make up a PC and what you need to think about when selecting those components, before helping you determine your needs and suggesting various configurations to fit those uses. Breaking the process down into its simplest terms, the authors provide component lists for a number of different PC setups: for students, home users, multimedia/home-theater enthusiasts, high-end graphic/video/audio producers, and more. Using plain language and plenty of visual and instructional aids--photos, illustrations, diagrams, step-by-step directions, and more--the authors ensure that even someone (like you!) who knows nothing about technology can build the perfect PC! On a more personal note, the authors are donating a percentage of their income from this book to the Breast Cancer Research Foundationï¾\\x96to thank all the women in their lives who have supported them and battled the disease.

Both are about likelihood ratios: Kullback-Leibler divergence is the expected log-likelihood ratio, and the Neyman-Pearson lemma is about error rates of likelihood ratio tests. Exploring this connection gives another statistical interpretation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in terms of the loss of power of the likelihood ratio test when the wrong distribution is used for one of the hypotheses. In this interpretation, the standard non-negativity property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is essentially a restatement of the optimal property of likelihood ratios established by the Neyman-Pearson lemma. The asymmetry of Kullback-Leibler divergence is overviewed in information geometry.\\n',\n",

       " \"#!Motivation: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. Results: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis---TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. Availability: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL).

Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers is for programmers and businesspeople who want to take full advantage of the vast resources available on the Web. There's no reason to let browsers limit your online experience-especially when you can easily automate online tasks to suit your individual needs. Learn how to write webbots and spiders that do all this and more: Programmatically download entire websites Effectively parse data from web pages Manage cookies Decode encrypted files Automate form submissions Send and receive email Send SMS alerts to your cell phone Unlock password-protected websites Automatically bid in online auctions Exchange data with FTP and NNTP servers Sample projects using standard code libraries reinforce these new skills. You'll learn how to create your own webbots and spiders that track online prices, aggregate different data sources into a single web page, and archive the online data you just can't live without. You'll learn inside information from an experienced webbot developer on how and when to write stealthy webbots that mimic human behavior, tips for developing fault-tolerant designs, and various methods for launching and scheduling webbots. You'll also get advice on how to write webbots and spiders that respect website owner property rights, plus techniques for shielding websites from unwanted robots. As a bonus, visit the author's website to test your webbots on sample target pages, and to download the scripts and code libraries used in the book. Some tasks are just too tedious-or too important!- to leave to humans. Once you've automated your online life, you'll never let a browser limit the way you use the Internet again.\\n\",\n",
